        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission at StudyNest is straightforward: "With the correct support, every child can learn and develop." </p>

        <h2>Who we are?</h2>
        <p>We founded StudyNest with several objectives in mind: to support students who feel behind in their studies, to focus on their needs and to assist them in gaining knowledge.
        <p>We observed how many kids in the first through ninth grades struggle with ideas, get insecure, and begin to think of themselves as "weak."  That is untrue. </p>
        <p>All students are capable of learning and developing; they only require the appropriate guidance, encouragement and time.</p>   
        <p>Every student is our top priority at StudyNest, and we provide them with the same level of care and assistance to ensure their success.</p>
        <p>We take pride in being a place where kids may learn with clarity, curiosity, and no fear.</p>

        <h2>Meet the Tutor</h2>
        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="profile image" class="profile">
        <p>With years of committed teaching experience, I have been mentoring primary and secondary school pupils, strengthening their fundamentals and laying a solid foundation for later coursework. </p>
        <p> My method is centered on patience, clarity, and an awareness of the individual needs of every child.</p>
        <p>Many of our students have performed exceptionally well over the years on various academic and scholarship tests in addition to their school exams.</p>
        <p> Students who previously felt weak or left behind have been successfully changed by our classes into self-assured learners who are prepared to take on academic challenges head-on.</p>
        <p>“I don’t just teach to complete the syllabus. I teach to build your child’s confidence and clarity.”</p>
