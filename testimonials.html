                <h4>Myron Furtado-St. Annes School</h4>
                <p>I've been studying at StudyNest tutorials from sixth grade to eighth grade. 
                She's been the best teacher, motivator, and guide. Always inspired and encouraged and
                 made me a better person every single day. She is a good-hearted and is someone I
                will always be grateful to. Assisting them improve and increase their knowledge, 
                I would recommend any parent to send their children to her for tutoring.</p>

            <h4>Janvi Thakur- Sr. JP High School</h4>
            <p>I am studying with Miss Dina since class 8th. She has been amazing. 
                She made me realise the importance of multiple revisions and consistent writing practice.
                She always cared,nurtured and educated me like my mother. She is and will always be my second home.
                I highly recommend maam for her extra ordinary teaching skills.</p>

        <h4>Bhoomi Singh - St. Joseph School</h4>
        <p>It was great that I got to study under Teacher Dina.
            I started learning from her in nursery, and she has always been so helpful.Whenever 
            I have doubts, she is always there to help me. Her guidance is amazing. The way she teaches 
            is simple and easy to understand. Now, I am in 8th grade and I am still studying under her guidance.</p>
